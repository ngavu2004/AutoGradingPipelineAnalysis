TIP_BH_Adult_OP_-_Care_Coordinator_Charter,Project Overview,21,"The problem summary provides a clear and logical problem statement that identifies the importance of having a care coordinator for patients' whole-person services. The description is concise but effectively conveys the issue at hand. The desired outcomes mention improved clinical care focused on the whole person, which is a clear and measurable goal. However, it would be more effective if it explicitly stated the expected results or outcomes. The benefits section mentions staff having training and an internal structure to implement the Model of Care (MOC), but it could be more detailed in explaining how this will positively impact patients' care",597224874,82762024,https://canvas.instructure.com/files/260330154/download?download_frd=1&verifier=nsNQc5HibxBsL5meAwEVylV8WrXVdvlqytYC6sCq,_4499,1.0,"I see a detailed problem summary with appropriate desired outcome(s) and expected benefits.
