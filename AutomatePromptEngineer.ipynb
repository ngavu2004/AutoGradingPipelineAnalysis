The language is clear and concise, providing a good understanding of the purpose and objectives of the project. Additionally, the inclusion of relevant context, such as the current state of Z code utilization, adds depth to the description.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The submission meets the requirements by listing the \"TIP 2.0 Process Milestone\" attribute, specifically mentioning that it's \"Milestone 3\". However, the description could be more detailed and provide a clearer explanation of what the milestone entails, which is why I'm grading it as a 3 instead of a 5.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The submission meets the requirements by providing specific milestone information, specifically mentioning \"Milestone 3\". However, the description does not provide detailed, multi-sentence responses about the milestone itself, but rather focuses on the project's purpose and scope. To achieve a higher grade, it would be beneficial to include more information about what specifically is being achieved or accomplished at this particular milestone.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a clear and concise summary of the project, including its purpose and expected outcomes. It meets most of the requirements, but could be improved by providing more detail on what specifically will be achieved through this process (e.g., what specific benefits will HealthyU gain from tracking and stratifying social determinants of health needs?). Overall, it provides a good foundation for understanding the project's goals and objectives.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a clear statement of the goal or purpose of the project, which is to improve the identification and utilization of Z code diagnoses via the HRSN screening tool. The description also explains the importance of this project in tracking and stratifying social determinants of health needs across the patient population, including children and adolescents. However, it could be more detailed by providing specific metrics or outcomes that the project aims to achieve.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a clear purpose for the project, stating that it aims to improve the identification and utilization of Z code diagnoses via the HRSN screening tool. Additionally, it explains the expected outcome of this improvement, which is to track and stratify social determinants of health needs across the patient population. However, the response could be more detailed by providing specific metrics or benchmarks for measuring success.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a logical problem description related to the project, stating that the conversion of HRSN screening results into trackable Z-code diagnoses is currently low (14%), which limits the clinic's ability to track patient social needs across the entire patient population. The problem summary is clear and concise, providing a good foundation for the rest of the overview section. However, it could be even stronger with more detail on the specific challenges or consequences resulting from this limitation.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a clear and concise description of the desired outcome, specifically stating that the goal is to increase the number of patients with appropriate Z-code diagnoses. This meets the requirements, but could be improved by including more detail about what this increased conversion rate will mean for the clinic's ability to track patient health-related social needs and address any areas where there may be a need for additional community resources/support.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The \"Benefits:\" attribute does provide a brief description of the benefits of the project, highlighting the increased ability to track patient health-related social needs and identify trends related to social determinants of health, which can lead to addressing areas where additional community resources or support are needed. While it's a good start, the response could be more detailed and multi-sentence to truly demonstrate comprehensive thinking about the benefits of the project.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The task list appears to cover some essential tasks in the project, such as meeting with medical providers to identify barriers, conducting a Root Cause Analysis, and re-training medical providers on the Z-code diagnosis screening and attribution process. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about what specific steps will be taken during each task and how progress will be monitored. Additionally, there is no mention of tasks related to implementing changes or addressing any issues that may arise from the project.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The submission provides a list of tasks with specific due dates, which meets the requirements. However, it would be beneficial to have more detailed descriptions of each task, including expected outcomes and responsible individuals. Providing this additional information would elevate the submission to a grade 5.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The \"In Scope Project Objectives\" clearly state the core purpose of the project, which is to increase utilization of Z-code diagnoses using quality improvement strategies. The objective is concise and directly addresses the project's main goal. A minor critique would be that the scope statement could benefit from a bit more detail or context about what specifically will be improved or changed within the current process to achieve this objective. Overall, however, the submission effectively conveys the core purpose of the project.\n","Grade: 5. Comment: The submission provides a clear \"In Scope\" statement outlining the primary objective of the project, and also includes an \"Out of Scope\" section that explicitly lists non-aligned objectives or activities. The language is concise and easy to understand, providing a good example of how to effectively define scope for a project.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The submission provides the necessary information on in-scope and out-of-scope project objectives. However, it could be improved by providing more detail on how these objectives align with key project milestones. A simple list of objectives without explanation does not fully demonstrate alignment. Nevertheless, meeting the minimum requirements earns a score of 3.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The \"Team Lead:\" attribute is filled with the team lead's name, Emily Bofetta.

The language is clear and concise, providing a solid foundation for understanding the project's objectives and expected outcomes.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides a good start in describing the desired outcomes, but it could be more detailed. It mentions specific goals, such as having 15% of families signed up on the platform, but it would be beneficial to elaborate on what this means in terms of concrete results (e.g., number of resources accessed, improved social and economic outcomes). Additionally, the language used is generally straightforward, but some sentences could be rephrased for greater clarity.

Comment: The task list provides a good starting point, but it seems to be missing some essential tasks that are crucial to the project's success. For example, there is no mention of testing or quality assurance, which is important for ensuring that the process works as intended. Additionally, the timeline only shows three months, but it's likely that the project will take longer than that to complete. Providing more detail on the scope and duration of the project would be helpful in clarifying the tasks involved.\n","Grade: 4. Comment: The submission provides specific task names, descriptions, and completion dates for each task. Each task has a specific month associated with it (Month 1, Month 2, etc.), which meets the criteria of having a specific due date. However, the due dates could be more precise (e.g., Task 1 is to be completed by the end of Month 1) rather than just being associated with a general timeframe. Overall, the submission provides the necessary information and demonstrates a good understanding of task planning and scheduling.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The \"In Scope Project Objectives\" section provides a brief description of the project's goals, which is good. However, the responses could be more detailed and multi-sentence in nature to better reflect the project's core purpose. As it stands, the submission only provides a few bullet points that do not fully convey the scope of the project.\n","Grade: 5.

Additionally, it includes an \"Out of Scope\" section that clearly defines what is excluded from the project's scope, making it easy to understand what is included and what is not.\n","Grade: 3. Comment: The submission provides a clear distinction between in-scope and out-of-scope project objectives, which meets the requirement.
