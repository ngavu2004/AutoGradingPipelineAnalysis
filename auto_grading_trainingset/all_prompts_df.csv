Problem Summary:
Main Street Healthcare has observed a significant performance gap in the completion of
primary care appointments among patients with public insurance. Despite efforts to
provide high-quality care, Main Street has a high no-show rate and low appointment
adherence among this patient group. The current completion rate for primary care
appointments among patients with public insurance is 60%, compared to an 85%
completion rate among privately insured patients. This 25% performance gap indicates
that patients with public insurance are missing crucial primary care visits, which affects
their overall health outcomes and the facility's ability to deliver equitable care.
The impact on patients includes unmanaged chronic conditions, delayed diagnosis of
new health issues, and inadequate preventive care. Healthcare providers face increased
workloads and stress as they attempt to accommodate rescheduled appointments and
manage the health complications arising from missed visits. The high no-show rate
disrupts clinic operations, leading to inefficiencies, wasted resources, and scheduling
difficulties, impacting the overall workflow and morale of the staff.

Desired Outcome(s):
Key Deliverables
1. Barrier Analysis Report: Detailed analysis of the barriers faced by publicly
insured patients in completing appointments.
2. Intervention Plan: Comprehensive plan outlining the targeted interventions to
address identified barriers.
3. Educational Materials: Culturally and linguistically appropriate educational
resources for patients.
4. Training Programs: Training sessions for staff on the importance of health
equity and strategies to improve appointment adherence.
5. Progress Reports: Regular updates on the progress of the project, including key
metrics and feedback from patients and staff.
Project Goal
Increase the percentage of completed primary care appointments among individuals
with public insurance by 20% within three months.

Benefits:
Improving completed primary care appointments among patients with public insurance
enhances health outcomes through early detection and preventive care, reduces
healthcare costs by lowering emergency visits and hospitalizations, and improves patient
engagement and satisfaction by fostering trust and continuity of care. It promotes health
equity by addressing disparities and ensuring equal access to services, empowers
vulnerable populations, and optimizes resource utilization by reducing no-show rates
and improving clinic workflow. Additionally, it strengthens community health through
better population health management and public health initiatives, creating a more
efficient and equitable healthcare system.

Screening for health-related social needs (or social determinants of health) allows a clinician to assess a comprehensive
history of lifestyle and social factors that impact health. Screening for HRSN has demonstrated a positive impact on
health outcomes, decrease in emergency room visit, and improved establishment of healthy habits. Barriers to seeking
health care, lifestyle choices, and/or safety are easier to identify and interventions offered. Screening in a pediatric
primary care practice impacts both the pediatric patient and the overall health of the family.

Problem Summary:
Consistent and universal screening for health-related social needs of the pediatric
population improved health outcome and reduces overall healthcare costs. Screening
has also been demonstrated to decrease health disparities. Variable studies have
suggested that 19-65% of families screened report at least one HRSN. Of those who
reported a HRSN, 22-58% accepted resources to address these needs. Barriers include
time limits to address such issues, clinicians feeling unable to address identified needs,
trust and/or reluctance of patients to divulge concerns. A recent study suggests that
patients are more likely to answer HRSN screening electronically versus paper. While
access to internet is also a barrier, having access to inoffice electronic screening can help
relieve this. Thus this program strives to assess HRSN to improve health behaviors and
outcomes while decreasing barrier and disparities in receiving care.
Desired Outcome(s):
1. Institute and increase routine HRSN (SDOH) screening annually
2. Establish relationship with community based referral source to address
identified needs on screening
3. Connect families with identified needs with community resources
4. Decrease barriers to receiving health care
5. Create efficient and effective screening workflow that
Benefits:
With effective screening that limits barriers and a workflow that connects needs with
resources, a decrease in social needs that negatively impact health are decreased and
health outcomes in children, family and later adults are improved.

Problem Summary:
Consistent and universal screening for health-related social needs of the pediatric
population improved health outcome and reduces overall healthcare costs. Screening
has also been demonstrated to decrease health disparities. Variable studies have
suggested that 19-65% of families screened report at least one HRSN. Of those who
reported a HRSN, 22-58% accepted resources to address these needs. Barriers include
time limits to address such issues, clinicians feeling unable to address identified needs,
trust and/or reluctance of patients to divulge concerns. A recent study suggests that
patients are more likely to answer HRSN screening electronically versus paper. While
access to internet is also a barrier, having access to inoffice electronic screening can help
relieve this. Thus this program strives to assess HRSN to improve health behaviors and
outcomes while decreasing barrier and disparities in receiving care.
Desired Outcome(s):
1. Institute and increase routine HRSN (SDOH) screening annually
2. Establish relationship with community based referral source to address
identified needs on screening
3. Connect families with identified needs with community resources
4. Decrease barriers to receiving health care
5. Create efficient and effective screening workflow that
Benefits:
With effective screening that limits barriers and a workflow that connects needs with
resources, a decrease in social needs that negatively impact health are decreased and
health outcomes in children, family and later adults are improved.

Problem Summary:
Currently, we are collecting the SDOH data, but we are limited in analyzing that
information to identify health inequities and health-related social needs. The
information is captured in our electronic medical record, but it is not easily extrapolated
into meaningful information.
Desired Outcome(s):
The desired outcomes of this project are:
- Utilize our existing ODBC connection to build Tableau reports to aggregate
demographic, clinical, and SDOH scoring data. This report will serve as a bridge
as we move from our existing EHR to an upgraded system with more robust
population health reporting.
- Design a seamless reporting system to minimize trends to data points while
implementing a new EMR system. Anticipated implementation will be Q4
2024/Q1 2025.
- Data analysis will guide needed interventions. Anticipated area of focus to be
on transportation to and from medical and behavioral health treatment.
Benefits:
As an integrated ambulatory practice, we recognize that screening for health-related
social needs offers substantial benefits that enhance patient care and outcomes. By
identifying and addressing factors such as housing instability, food insecurity,
transportation challenges, and social isolation within the outpatient setting, healthcare
providers can offer a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach. This
integration allows for immediate referrals to social services and community resources,
Project Charter
ensuring that patients receive the necessary support to manage their health conditions
effectively. Consequently, this proactive strategy can prevent complications, reduce
emergency room visits, and decrease hospital readmissions, ultimately leading to better
health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
Moreover, incorporating social needs screening into the routine workflow of an
integrated ambulatory practice fosters stronger patient-provider relationships. When
patients see that their healthcare team cares about their overall well-being, including
their social circumstances, they are more likely to trust and engage with their providers.
This trust is crucial for effective chronic disease management and adherence to
treatment plans. Additionally, by addressing social determinants of health, the practice
can help mitigate health disparities, promoting greater health equity among its patient
population. This holistic approach not only improves individual patient experiences but
also strengthens the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.

Desired Outcome(s):
The desired outcomes of this project are:
- Utilize our existing ODBC connection to build Tableau reports to aggregate
demographic, clinical, and SDOH scoring data. This report will serve as a bridge
as we move from our existing EHR to an upgraded system with more robust
population health reporting.
- Design a seamless reporting system to minimize trends to data points while
implementing a new EMR system. Anticipated implementation will be Q4
2024/Q1 2025.
- Data analysis will guide needed interventions. Anticipated area of focus to be
on transportation to and from medical and behavioral health treatment.
Benefits:
As an integrated ambulatory practice, we recognize that screening for health-related
social needs offers substantial benefits that enhance patient care and outcomes. By
identifying and addressing factors such as housing instability, food insecurity,
transportation challenges, and social isolation within the outpatient setting, healthcare
providers can offer a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach. This
integration allows for immediate referrals to social services and community resources,
Project Charter
ensuring that patients receive the necessary support to manage their health conditions
effectively. Consequently, this proactive strategy can prevent complications, reduce
emergency room visits, and decrease hospital readmissions, ultimately leading to better
health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
Moreover, incorporating social needs screening into the routine workflow of an
integrated ambulatory practice fosters stronger patient-provider relationships. When
patients see that their healthcare team cares about their overall well-being, including
their social circumstances, they are more likely to trust and engage with their providers.
This trust is crucial for effective chronic disease management and adherence to
treatment plans. Additionally, by addressing social determinants of health, the practice
can help mitigate health disparities, promoting greater health equity among its patient
population. This holistic approach not only improves individual patient experiences but
also strengthens the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.

Project Name: Community Cares Utilization and Data Management
Clinic: A New Leaf
Process: Monitoring and reporting referral data for improved utilization and outcomes.
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Connect to and demonstrate effective use of the statewide closed loop referral
system (Community Cares), or other closed loop referral system(s) that can report
referral-level details, to connect members seen to community resources.
Project Description / Purpose
Enter a brief description of the project, the purpose for conducting the project and a general description of what is
expected to result from the project.
Our agency utilizes Community Cares closed loop referral system to connect members to community resources. This
referral platform was launched across programs in January 2023 . During the first implementation phase in our agency,
staff were provided access, trained, and a high level oversight and monitoring was occurring as we adopted the
platform into several programs. The agency has since been using the system more regularly and data reporting and
metrics have become available recently through a Workforce Management Dashboard. Our project is for
Management/Director level staff to understand, utilize, and be able to monitor outcomes for their programs utilizing
the new dashboard and reports available. Information and data can then drive process improvements and efficiencies,
help identify gaps in services, and create potential networking opportunities that benefit clients and programs.

Project Name: Community Cares Utilization and Data Management
Clinic: A New Leaf
Process: Monitoring and reporting referral data for improved utilization and outcomes.
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Connect to and demonstrate effective use of the statewide closed loop referral
system (Community Cares), or other closed loop referral system(s) that can report
referral-level details, to connect members seen to community resources.
Project Description / Purpose
Enter a brief description of the project, the purpose for conducting the project and a general description of what is
expected to result from the project.
Our agency utilizes Community Cares closed loop referral system to connect members to community resources. This
referral platform was launched across programs in January 2023 . During the first implementation phase in our agency,
staff were provided access, trained, and a high level oversight and monitoring was occurring as we adopted the
platform into several programs. The agency has since been using the system more regularly and data reporting and
metrics have become available recently through a Workforce Management Dashboard. Our project is for
Management/Director level staff to understand, utilize, and be able to monitor outcomes for their programs utilizing
the new dashboard and reports available. Information and data can then drive process improvements and efficiencies,
help identify gaps in services, and create potential networking opportunities that benefit clients and programs.

The agency will fully utilize the data reporting system, Workforce Dashboard, to
monitor staff usage and outcomes of referrals submitted/received.
Management/Director level staff will be trained and able to run, monitor, and evaluate
data and reports that may improve processes, identify gaps in services, and create
standards for staff utilization.
Benefits:

By having reports and data that are understood and monitored by managers/directors,
this provides oversight on many levels. Standards can be created for staff that holds
them accountable for utilization and follow through on referrals for clients, supervisors
are monitoring and managing outcomes for their staff and programs, and leadership is
able to clearly understand any gaps in services or resources.

Project Name: SDOH screen
Clinic: Pleasant Pediatrics - all clinic locations
Process: Distribution of screening tool and documentation of screening results
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Milestone 1c
Project Description / Purpose
SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) screening tools are helpful to identify barriers in a patientâ€™s life that can affect
their health outcomes. Having a clear picture of our patientâ€™s socioeconomic needs helps providers make better decisions
and direct better care and referrals specifically for their patient.
Pleasant Pediatrics has done an SDOH screening tool in the past but was not continued for varied reasons (parent
dissatisfaction, lack of resources to refer to, lack of staff to manage the care, etc). The purpose of this project is to
resume, improve and continue SDOH screening with a goal of 95% completion rate in completed screens AND proper
documentation over 8 consecutive weeks. The success of this project will improve our case identification and connect
more patients with appropriate referrals, resources, and better treatment plans based on known socioeconomic status.

Project Name: SDOH screen
Clinic: Pleasant Pediatrics - all clinic locations
Process: Distribution of screening tool and documentation of screening results
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Milestone 1c
Project Description / Purpose
SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) screening tools are helpful to identify barriers in a patientâ€™s life that can affect
their health outcomes. Having a clear picture of our patientâ€™s socioeconomic needs helps providers make better decisions
and direct better care and referrals specifically for their patient.
Pleasant Pediatrics has done an SDOH screening tool in the past but was not continued for varied reasons (parent
dissatisfaction, lack of resources to refer to, lack of staff to manage the care, etc). The purpose of this project is to
resume, improve and continue SDOH screening with a goal of 95% completion rate in completed screens AND proper
documentation over 8 consecutive weeks. The success of this project will improve our case identification and connect
more patients with appropriate referrals, resources, and better treatment plans based on known socioeconomic status.

Grade this submission:
Problem Summary:
Non-medical conditions that significantly affect health and quality of life are called social
determinants of health (SDOH). In the past Pleasant Pediatrics did participate in this
type of screening but was dropped for several reasons. With participation in quality
improvement projects, Pleasant Pediatrics is determined and desires to resume and
improve on completing the screening so we can provide referrals, resources and
providers can create better treatment plans for our patients. Since it has been several
years since this tool has been regularly implemented, no referrals for resources have
been done and there has been less knowledge about patientâ€™s socioeconomic status
when making treatment plans.
Desired Outcome(s):
Increase the number of completed SDOH screens AND proper documentation of age
appropriate patients; and thus downstream referrals and resources for patientâ€™s and
their families.
Benefits:
The success of this project will increase our chance for identifying patients with
socioeconomic deficits and provide them with proper support, referrals, and treatment.

Problem Summary:
Problem or Performance Gap
The Phoenix Dream Center clinic, part of the Williams Family Medical
Initiative, is currently facing a significant performance gap in terms of
patient engagement, recalcitrant treatment options, and satisfaction and
billing issues related to behavioral health. Many residents feel
disconnected from the clinic, leading to low utilization of healthcare
services and trust issues. The dream center is also unable to perform
behavioral health services, finally turning this over to Williams Family
Medicine. This disengagement is often due to a lack of trust, perceived
cultural insensitivity, and a historical lack of community involvement in
healthcare decisions within the patient population. Consequently, there are
noticeable disparities in health outcomes among the community, often
linked to unaddressed social determinants of health such as housing
instability, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare education; lack of staff and inadequate/ineffective billing also causes a financial
strain on the phoenix dream centers 300 residents.
Impact on Staff
Increased Burnout: Clinic staff experience high levels of frustration and
burnout due to inefficiencies and the inability to meet the diverse
needs of patients effectively.
Strained Relationships: The lack of a structured feedback mechanism
means that staff are often unaware of patient concerns until they
escalate, leading to strained staff-patient relationships.
Operational Inefficiencies: Staff spend considerable time managing
avoidable issues that arise from poor patient engagement and
unaddressed social needs, detracting from direct patient care activities.
Under paid staff
Impact on Patients
Low Trust and Engagement: Patients feel underserved and neglected,
exacerbating distrust in the healthcare system. This results in lower
clinic attendance and poorer health outcomes.
Health Disparities: The lack of tailored healthcare services and
insufficient attention to social determinants of health contribute to
significant disparities in health outcomes within the community.
Underutilization of Services: Due to the negative perception and lack of
trust, many residents underutilize the available healthcare services,
which can lead to worsening health conditions and preventable hospital
visits.
Leaving the Dream center and turning back to addiction
By addressing these issues through the establishment of a Community
Advisory Board and integrating community feedback into clinic
operations, Williams Family Medicine and the Phoenix Dream Center
clinic aims to bridge these gaps, improving both staff satisfaction and
patient health outcomes and successfully billing for behavioral health
services.
Desired Outcome(s):
Desired Outcomes of the Project
1. Increased Patient Trust and Engagement: By actively involving the
community in decision-making processes through the advisory board,
the clinic aims to rebuild trust and enhance patient engagement with
healthcare services.
2. Reduction in Health Disparities: The project seeks to identify and
address social determinants of health that contribute to disparities,
ensuring all residents have equitable access to healthcare and support
services.
Project Charter
3. Improved Staff Morale and Efficiency: Streamlined processes for
collecting and acting on patient feedback will help reduce staff burnout
by making their work more efficient and fulfilling. This includes
providing staff with the tools and training needed to address the holistic
needs of their patients.
4. Tailored and Effective Healthcare Services: This includes Physical and
Mental Health. The clinic will be able to adapt its services based on
real-time feedback from the community, ensuring that care is
personalized and meets the specific needs of the Dream Center
residents.
5. Enhanced Community Health Outcomes: By addressing both the
medical and social needs of the community, the project aims to
improve overall health outcomes, reduce preventable hospital visits,
and enhance the quality of life for residents.
6. Sustainable Community Engagement: Establishing a community
advisory board will create a lasting platform for continuous community
involvement and feedback, ensuring that the clinic remains responsive
to the evolving needs of the residents.
7. Data-Driven Decision Making: The project will generate valuable data
that can be used to inform future healthcare strategies and initiatives,
leading to continuous improvement in patient care and clinic
operations.
8. Successful billing of behavioral health
The Major desired outcome is effective mental
and physical services being provided to the
dream centers residents.
Benefits:
Expected Results
The project is expected to result in increased patient trust and satisfaction,
reduced health disparities, improved staff morale and efficiency, and more
tailored healthcare services. It will also foster sustainable community
engagement and provide valuable data for continuous improvement.
Additionally, this initiative aims to enhance the overall quality of life for
residents by addressing both medical and social needs.

Problem Summary:
Problem or Performance Gap
The Phoenix Dream Center clinic, part of the Williams Family Medical
Initiative, is currently facing a significant performance gap in terms of
patient engagement, recalcitrant treatment options, and satisfaction and
billing issues related to behavioral health. Many residents feel
disconnected from the clinic, leading to low utilization of healthcare
services and trust issues. The dream center is also unable to perform
behavioral health services, finally turning this over to Williams Family
Medicine. This disengagement is often due to a lack of trust, perceived
cultural insensitivity, and a historical lack of community involvement in
healthcare decisions within the patient population. Consequently, there are
noticeable disparities in health outcomes among the community, often
linked to unaddressed social determinants of health such as housing
instability, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare education; lack of staff and inadequate/ineffective billing also causes a financial
strain on the phoenix dream centers 300 residents.
Impact on Staff
Increased Burnout: Clinic staff experience high levels of frustration and
burnout due to inefficiencies and the inability to meet the diverse
needs of patients effectively.
Strained Relationships: The lack of a structured feedback mechanism
means that staff are often unaware of patient concerns until they
escalate, leading to strained staff-patient relationships.
Operational Inefficiencies: Staff spend considerable time managing
avoidable issues that arise from poor patient engagement and
unaddressed social needs, detracting from direct patient care activities.
Under paid staff
Impact on Patients
Low Trust and Engagement: Patients feel underserved and neglected,
exacerbating distrust in the healthcare system. This results in lower
clinic attendance and poorer health outcomes.
Health Disparities: The lack of tailored healthcare services and
insufficient attention to social determinants of health contribute to
significant disparities in health outcomes within the community.
Underutilization of Services: Due to the negative perception and lack of
trust, many residents underutilize the available healthcare services,
which can lead to worsening health conditions and preventable hospital
visits.
Leaving the Dream center and turning back to addiction
By addressing these issues through the establishment of a Community
Advisory Board and integrating community feedback into clinic
operations, Williams Family Medicine and the Phoenix Dream Center
clinic aims to bridge these gaps, improving both staff satisfaction and
patient health outcomes and successfully billing for behavioral health
services.

Project Name: Implementing a new referral process
Clinic: Kids and Family Kare
Process: The provider will request referrals for a patient and send the task to a medical assistant.
The Medical assistant will then look for a specialist near the patientâ€™s home that accepts
patient insurance. Once the referral is made and faxed to the specialist office, the patient
will receive a call from the medical assistant to share this information. In a week, the
medical assistant will contact the patient again and make sure the appointment has been
made with a specialist.
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Referrals
Project Description / Purpose
This new referral process will help us create better communication between the patients and ensure they are receiving
proper care.

Problem Summary:
With our current referral process, after the referral is made, we do not reach out to
confirm an appointment has been made with the specialist, therefore, many patients do
not continue with their plan of care.
Desired Outcome(s):
Have better communication between patients and their specialists.
Benefits:
Patients will continue their plan of care and communication between primary care and
specialists will become better.

In Scope Project Objectives
1. Training and Informing Staff: Conduct training sessions to inform all relevant staff (providers, medical
assistants, administrative staff) about the new referral process and its implementation.
2. Referral Process Implementation: Ensure medical assistants locate specialists near the patient's home who
accept the patient's insurance, make the referrals, and fax the referral details to the specialist's office.
3. Patient Communication and Follow-Up: Implement a system where medical assistants call patients to
inform them about the referral and follow up after one week to confirm that the appointment has been
made with the specialist
Out of Scope Project Objectives or Activities
Out of Scope Project Objectives or Activities
1. Specialist Office Coordination: Directly coordinating with specialist offices to ensure they have received the
referral and scheduling the appointments for the patients is out of scope.
2. Insurance Verification Beyond Initial Referral: Verifying and handling any insurance issues that arise after
the initial referral process is out of scope. This includes dealing with any changes in insurance or coverage
issues that the patient might face after the referral is made.
3. Patient Transport Arrangements: Arranging transportation for patients to attend specialist appointments is
out of scope. Patients will be responsible for their own transportation to and from specialist appointments

Project Name: Decrease health disparities by identifying health needs by increasing access to
preventative screenings.
Clinic: Southwest Network Pediatric Clinics
Process: Complete metabolic laboratory testing and vitals for children receiving services as
identified in best practices from SAMHSA.
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Process, policies, and increase health equity to patients.
Project Description / Purpose
Health disparities are inequitable and are directly related to the unequal distribution of social, political, environmental
resources. For the children that are receiving psychiatric care in Southwest Networks pediatric clinics, this comes in the
form of increased incidence of chronic conditions because of necessary prescribing of antipsychotic medications.
Identifying risk factors for childhood diabetes, hypertension, and obesity will be increased with routine, scheduled
metabolic testing for all children prescribed antipsychotic medications, which significantly increases risk factors for
chronic conditions. Completion of metabolic screenings and vitals (height, weight, blood pressure, lipid profiles, other
as clinically indicated).

form of increased incidence of chronic conditions because of necessary prescribing of antipsychotic medications.
Identifying risk factors for childhood diabetes, hypertension, and obesity will be increased with routine, scheduled
metabolic testing for all children prescribed antipsychotic medications, which significantly increases risk factors for
chronic conditions. Completion of metabolic screenings and vitals (height, weight, blood pressure, lipid profiles, other
as clinically indicated).

Problem Summary:
Antipsychotic prescribing for children and adolescents can elevate risk factors
for developing serious metabolic health complications that can lead to lifelong
chronic conditions (NCQA, 2024). Antipsychotic medications can lead to weight
gain, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, increase the risk of developing Type 2
diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. Regular metabolic testing ensures
early detection and management of these potential side effects, safeguarding
the child's overall health and well-being while enabling the safe and effective
use of necessary psychiatric treatments.
Desired Outcome(s):
Identify risk factors that could lead to chronic conditions by offering preventative
metabolic screenings for each child prescribed antipsychotic medications. Offering
families resources to decrease the risk of developing chronic conditions through
community cares (UNITEUS) closed loop system, and other community providers.
Benefits:
Addressing risk factors are important for improving overall health, reducing health
disparities in the community.

Problem Summary:
HealthyU administers HRSN screenings to all patients & patient caregivers for children
as part of the patient check-in process. However, conversion of the HRSN screening
results into trackable Z-code diagnosis is currently at 14%. This limits the clinicâ€™s ability
to track patient identified social needs across the entire patient population.
Desired Outcome(s):
Increase the number of patients with appropriate Z-code diagnoses.
Benefits:
This process will increase the opportunity to track patient health related social needs
across the patient population to identify trends related to social determinants of health
and address any areas where there is a need for additional community
resources/support.

Problem Summary:
Enter description of problem or performance gap identified here. Include descriptions of
the impact to staff and/or patients.
MIKID serves under privileged families in rural communities where social and economic
resources are limited or nonexistent. MIKID as a stand-alone agency offers a variety of
services in these locations and recognizes a need for additional resources/Services
outside our scope.
The impact on families includes social and economic needs not being met. Families have
no additional support to these resources. In addition, no access to these resources
causing a great impact that leads to families vocalizing these needs to our providers.
Desired Outcome(s):

Implementation of the Unite us platform would give opportunity and access to the
resources available.
Hire a SDOH referral coordinator position to lead and coordinate with the families the
